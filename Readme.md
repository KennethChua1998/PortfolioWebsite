## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
*   [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/) knowledge recommended

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kenneth-chua/portfolio-website.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd portfolio-website
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Vue.js Development Commands

```sh
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Serve production build
npm run serve

# Lint and fix code
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Format code
npm run format
```

## Vue.js Best Practices & Architecture

This project follows Vue.js best practices and modern development patterns:

### **Component Architecture**
- **Single File Components (SFCs)** with `<script setup>` syntax
- **Composition API** for better logic reuse and TypeScript support
- **Composables** for shared reactive logic (Three.js, animations, form handling)
- **Props/Emits interface** with TypeScript definitions

### **Code Organization**
- **Feature-based structure** with clear separation of concerns
- **Composables directory** (`/composables`) for reusable logic
- **Components directory** (`/components`) with atomic design principles
- **Utils directory** (`/utils`) for pure functions and helpers

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Lazy loading** for route-based code splitting
- **`v-memo`** for expensive list rendering
- **`defineAsyncComponent`** for heavy components
- **Tree-shaking** with proper ES module imports

### **Development Workflow**
- **Vue DevTools** for debugging and performance profiling
- **ESLint + Vue rules** for consistent code quality
- **Prettier** integration for automated formatting
- **TypeScript** strict mode for type safety
- **Pinia** for predictable state management

## Development Roadmap

The original detailed specification can be found in the `SPECIFICATION.md` file. Here is a high-level overview of the development roadmap:

1.  **Setup & Scaffolding:** Initialize Vue.js project, integrate Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
2.  **Component Creation:** Build out each section as reusable Vue components with Composition API
3.  **WebGL Hero:** Develop interactive Three.js particle animation using Vue.js composables
4.  **Content Population:** Replace placeholder content with actual portfolio information
5.  **Animation & Polish:** Implement scroll-triggered animations using Vue.js transitions
6.  **Deployment:** Deploy optimized production build to cloud platforms
